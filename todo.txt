attribute:
    !! struct/union values
        see: the struct layout precipice
    attribute type: type
        as_enum for when you want an integer to be treated like an enum
            (or maybe just a general 'as')
    somehow handle data at an offset to a pointer ex. stb_ds
    members of complex type can specify an attribute as a value: I(default default)
    noserialize (for pointers)
    nodisplay
    ability to apply attributes to types
        ability to remove an attribute
    expression attribute type
        select: attribute describes when a member is valid, ex. unions
        length: change to expression ex. I(length map_width * map_height)
    parse c++ struct defaults as intro defaults?

city:
    stb_ds arrays (requires stb_ds attribute)

config:
    allow config to be appended with another config?
    handle c type sizes
    static assert in .intro file if types don't match
    windows install?
        msys?

parse:
    !! handle sizeof struct/union in expression
    stop parsing after a .intro include as to not depend on types defined later
    handle bit field accessing
    handle strings next to each other
    const flag?
    parse float expressions (for value attributes)
        be aware of types in expressions
    parse constants
    rudimentary C++ support
        operator overloads
        function overloads
        member functions
        namespaces
        ignore templates

pre:
    more options for what parts have information generated
        option to exclude by default, enable with #if __INTRO__
    save location of includes and defines
    parse #line directives
    trim big newline gaps
    create #line directives?

gen:
    !! clang doesn't like flexible array initialization in c++
        might be a good idea to not use flexible arrays at the interface level anyway as it can complicate interfacing in other languages
    option to flag types you care about and only output information necessary for those types
    option to create typedefs for structs and enums
    typeof with _Generic?

lib:
    accurate type display
    a little dubious and evil: ability to create types at runtime
    IntroVariant?
    sprint/mprint version of everything that uses stdout
    single header?

test:
    test for errors that should be raised by the parser
    more rigorous tests

examples:
    !! more of these

doc:
    parser --help status
    man page

misc:
    use custom allocators more + cleanup
    parse program options and pass only relevant ones to sub-processes
    preprocessor should output tokens instead of text

The struct layout precipice:
    Struct layout is dependent on the platform ABI.
    In addition to this there are many ways a struct layout can be altered (push(pack), __attribute__((aligned)), etc.)
    
    Right now, intro just generates offsetof's in the header.

    Ideally, C would have actual layout specifications, and we could easily generate all of the type information in a binary format.
    (Of course C would also ideally have introspection, but here we are.)

    The options are:

    Continue to use offsetof
        + guaranteed correct
        + easiest to implement (already done)
        - Only useful in C/C++
        - generated header is big and redundant
        - parser is limited in capability due to incomplete type information:
            struct value attribute are difficult (currently just unimplemented)
            certain expressions cannot be evaluated

    Calculate the correct layout information based on platform
        + generated information can be in binary form
        + language agnostic
        - incorrect generation is difficult/impossible to mitigate

# Attributes
Attributes are used to define extra information about types they are declared and applied using the `I` macro. This macro expands to nothing unless `__INTRO__` is defined, so it does not affect compilation:
```C
#ifndef __INTRO__
#define I(...)
#endif
```

## Declaring Attributes
Attributes are created with the following syntax:
```C
I(attribute namespace_ (
    name1: type,
    name2: type,
    ...
))
```

Builtin attributes are defined in the same way as custom attributes. You can see how they are defined in [lib/intro.h](lib/intro.h).   
  
See the [types](#types) section for information on available attribute types.  

## Applying attributes
Attributes can be applied to struct member declarations and typedef declarations using the `I` macro.  
  
The `I` macro can be placed directly before a declaration or directly after, preceeding the `;` or `,`. Multiple attributes can be applied using multiple macros or with commas.
  
```C
struct {
    int a I(id 1, =2);          // OK

    int b I(note "hello"),
        c I(~city) I(alias c0); // OK

    char * name; I(id 3)        // POTENTIAL BUG: attribute 'id 3' will be aplied to is_open, not name

    I(4) bool is_open;          // OK

    I(note "many many attributes")
    I(gui_min -1.0, gui_max 12.0, gui_scale 0.05)
    float stuff I(id 7);        // OK
};

typedef float Vector2 [2] I(vector, color {0,255,255,255});
```

Attributes can be referenced without their namespace if there are no name conflicts.  
  
Attributes can also be applied to a previously defined type using `apply_to`. For example the following is used in [lib/intro.h](lib/intro.h):
```C
I(apply_to (char *) (cstring))
```
The type must be contained in parenthesis like a cast. Following the type is a list of attributes as if they were declared directly on a member.

## Retrieving attributes

For information on how to retrieve attribute information in your program, see [LIB.md](doc/LIB.md).

# Builtin Attributes
These are the attributes provided by *intro*.

## Namespace: i_

### remove
Removes a previously applied attribute. Typically, the shorthand `~` is used.
```C
    int   some_constant I(remove gui_edit);
    float hidden I(~gui_show);
```

### id
**type:** [int](#int)   
Defines the id used for serialization. Every id in a structure must be unique and representable by a 16-bit unsigned integer. This is enforced by the parser.    
If there is a stray integer with no attribute defined, it is assumed to be an id, for convenience.
```C
    int   a I(id 1); // OK
    char  b I(2);    // OK
    char  b I(1985); // OK
    float c I(2);    // ERROR, duplicate ID
```

### btfld
**type:** [int](#int)
Can be used to retrieve the bitfield width of a member. It cannot be applied using the `I` macro.
```C
int32_t bit_width;
intro_attribute_int(member, i_btfld, &bit_width);
```

### default
**type:** [value(@inherit)](#value)   
**NOTE**: Some types might not support defaults. This is a work in progress.    
Defines the default used by [intro\_set\_defaults][intro_set_defaults] or [intro\_load\_city][intro_load_city] when no value is present in the city file.    
You can also use an equal sign `=` instead of the word default, for convenience.

```C
    int   a I(default 5);
    float b I(= 3.56);
    uint8_t arr [4] I(= {1, 2, 3, 4});
```

### length
**type:** [expr](#expr)   
Defines a sibling member which will be used to determine the length of a buffer during serialization in [intro\_create\_city][intro_create_city].
```C
    Tile * tiles I(length count_tiles);
    int count_tiles;
```

### alias
**type:** [value(char \*)](#value)   
Defines a name which will be treated like a match by [intro\_load\_city][intro_load_city].    
Use this if you are using member names for serialization and you change a name.    
While this attribute is of type *char \**, a single identifier without quotation marks is also accepted.
```C
    int health_points I(alias "hp");
    float speed I(alias velocity);
```

### city @global
**type:** [flag](#flag)
Determines that a value that is a pointer will be serialized by the city implementation.
```C
    CacheMap * internal_cache I(~city);
```

### cstring
**type:** [flag](#flag)
Determines that a pointer is to a null-terminated string. This is automatically applied to any value of type `char *`.
```C
struct MyString {
    char * str I(length len, ~cstring);
    int len;
};
```

### type
**type:** [flag](#flag)   
Marks the member to be set to the type of the structure it is within during `intro_set_defaults` or `intro_load_city`.    
Can only be applied to a member of type `IntroType *`.
```C
typedef struct {
    int a, b, c;
    IntroType * type I(type); // will be set to ITYPE(Entity)
} Entity;
```

## Namespace: gui_

Attributes in the `gui_` namespace are used by [intro\_imgui\_edit](lib/intro_imgui.cpp).

### note
**type:** [value(char \*)](#value)   
Defines a "help" note to be displayed with a member.

### name
**type:** [value(char \*)](#value)
Defines an alternative "friendly name" for a member.

### min
**type:** [value(@inherit)](#value)
Defines a minimum allowed value for a scalar.

### max
**type:** [value(@inherit)](#value)
Defines a maximum allowed value for a scalar.

### format
**type:** [string](#string)
Defines the display format used for a scalar.
```C
    float speed I(gui_format "%3.2f");
```

### color
**type:** [value(uint8\_t [4])](#value)
Changes the color of a member.

### vector
**type:** [flag](#flag)
Determines that a member is a vector.

### show @global
**type:** [flag](#flag)
Determines that a member is displayed.

### edit @global
**type:** [flag](#flag)
Determines that a member can be edited by the user.

### edit\_color
**type:** [flag](#flag)
Determines that a member is a color, and uses a specialized color editing widget.

### edit\_text
**type:** [flag](#flag)
Determines that a member is a buffer of editable text.

# Attribute Types

### int
Attribute is defined as an integer of type `int32_t`.

### float
Attribute is defined as a number of type `float`.

### member
Attribute is defined as a sibling member.

### value
Attribute is defined as a value of a specific type. The type is determined with parentheses:
```C
    some_value: value(MyType),
```

The type can also be defined as the type of the member or type it is applied to using @inherit.
```C
    some_default: value(@inherit),
```

### expr
Attribute is defined as an expression that is converted to bytecode. Currently the expression can only use integer values.   
The following is an example using the builtin "when" attribute which is of the expr type.
```C
struct Variant {
    union {
        int i   I(when <-type == T_INT);   // the <- operator accesses the parent
        float f I(when <-type == T_FLOAT);
    } value;

    enum {
        T_NONE,
        T_INT,
        T_FLOAT,
    } type;
};
```

### flag
Attribute is defined with no data. Flags can have the `@global` trait which means that they are applied to every type and member by default.
